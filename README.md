# ft_get_next_line
42 Madrid project
Grade: 125/100

This function will attempt several reads from a text file, returning a whole line everytime it is found. It makes use of a static variable that allows it to store the text remaining after the newline for consequential calls.
I see it as a introduction to text parsing for future system and network communication applications.
